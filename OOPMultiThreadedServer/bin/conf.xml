<!-- 
	Encapsulate Environmental Variables in an External Files

	Encapsulation is the shielding of a user / programme from the effect of change by
	separating the parts of a programme that vary, from the parts that stay the same. If
	a part of a programme is highly volatile and changes all the time and we have hard-coded
	this mutable information into a class, then we will find ourselves constantly updating
	the class and re-publishing it to propagate the changes.
	
	In the case of environmental variables, it is best to move them completely out of a
	class and into a file that can be read by the programme when it starts up. Any file format
	can suffice, eg. an *.ini or *.props file. XML documents however, are highly structured and
	make the parsing of such information easier than working with other formats.
